# Personal portfolio page

#### [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/LhPHbzLwI54)

#### I developed a personal portfolio website built with React, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure, style, and add interactivity. The main goal was to create a clean, modern, and responsive design that highlights my projects, skills, and background in a straightforward way.

#### The project emphasizes simplicity and smooth user experience, with a minimalistic layout, intuitive navigation, and clear visual hierarchy. I focused on writing reusable components in React, keeping the codebase organized and scalable for future updates. CSS was used to create a sleek, visually appealing style without overwhelming the content, while JavaScript adds subtle interactive elements to enhance user engagement.

#### Although the portfolio is relatively basic in terms of features, it serves as a strong foundation that can be expanded with more advanced functionalities like animations, API integrations, or dynamic content later on. The site reflects both my technical skills and my design approach â€” functional, modern, and user-focused.
